# Clustering-Geo-location-DBSCAN
Clustering is one of the major data mining methods for knowledge discovery in large databases. It is the process of grouping large data sets according to their similarity. Cluster analysis is a major tool in many areas of engineering and scientific applications including data segmentation, discretization of continuous attributes, data reduction, outlier detection, noise filtering, pattern recognition and image processing
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is an important spatial clustering technique that is widely adopted in numerous applications. 
DBSCAN is a clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density. Given that DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm, 
it does a great job of seeking areas in the data that have a high density of observations, versus areas of the data that are not very dense with observations.
